Q1. Create Employee structure
    struct Date{
        int day,
        int month,
        int year    
    } 
    struct Address{
        int flatNo,
        char City[100],
        char State[100]
        
    }  
     struct Employee{
        char name[100],
        int EmpId ,
        struct Date DOB
        struct Address add
    }.


Store Employee record in above structure and display it. Use Memory allocation method to allocate memory to structure.



Q2. Try the following code
union A
{
int x;
int y;
char ch;
};
union A a1;
a1.x=0x10;
a1.y=0x1121; print a1.x, a1.ch
Calculate size of union , offset of each member

Q3. Analyse the following code
union A
{
int x;
float y;
double z;
int arr[2];
}a1;
a1.y=6.25f;
printf(“x=%x\n”,a1.x);
a1.z=0.15625;;
printf(“%x%x\n”,a1.arr[1],a1.arr[0]);
